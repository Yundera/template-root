# authelia-ready.sh - wait for Authelia to SERVE, not merely to be restarted.
#
# Shared by ensure-authelia.sh (after it restarts Authelia on a re-rendered config)
# and ensure-auth-stack.sh (after the auth stack recreated it). Moved here from
# ensure-authelia.sh unchanged when the auth stack was split out. Expects log.sh.

# How long to wait for Authelia to answer again after a restart, and how often to
# ask. Authelia's own startup is ~3-6s on a PCS; the ceiling is deliberately
# generous because the two directions cost very different things:
#
#   * overshooting costs seconds on a self-check that already takes minutes;
#   * undershooting costs the PCS its Local Account login for a WHOLE CYCLE.
#
# The second one is not hypothetical. ensure-dex.sh renders the Local Account
# connector only if Authelia's discovery document answers, and it fail-closes.
# This script used to end with a fire-and-forget `docker restart authelia`, so
# ensure-dex.sh (next in scripts-config.txt) probed 1-2s later, always lost the
# race, and dropped the connector — every single cycle, not the "one cycle" its
# own comment predicted. Diagnosed on wisera 2026-09-28: 7 consecutive nights of
# "did not return a discovery document", a box whose only remaining connector was
# Yundera Login, and an owner locked out of their own PCS the moment the cloud
# account behind that connector was not the one the browser was signed into.
#
# The postcondition of this script is therefore "Authelia is SERVING", not "a
# restart was requested". Everything downstream already assumed the former.

# Is Authelia answering right now?
#
# Two independent signals, whichever says yes first:
#
#   1. Authelia's own /api/health over the container's bridge address. Port 9091
#      is `expose`d, not published, so this goes host -> docker bridge; it is the
#      fast signal (true within ~3-6s of a restart) and it is what actually
#      matters, because "the HTTP server is listening" is the precondition Caddy
#      and Dex both need.
#   2. The container's health status. The authelia image ships its own HEALTHCHECK
#      (/app/healthcheck.sh), but with interval 30s and start_period 60s, so this
#      only turns "healthy" ~30s in. It is the fallback for a host that cannot
#      reach the bridge directly.
#
# Never fatal: a false negative here only means we fall through to the timeout
# and let ensure-dex.sh's own retrying probe have the final say.
