# authelia-user-manager.sh - CRUD for Authelia's file-backend user store.
#
# Usage:
#   authelia-user-manager.sh list
#   authelia-user-manager.sh claim <username> [displayname]   # password on stdin
#   authelia-user-manager.sh claim --generate <username> [displayname]
#   authelia-user-manager.sh add <username> <displayname> <email> [groups-csv]
#   authelia-user-manager.sh delete <username>
#   authelia-user-manager.sh set-password <username>
#   authelia-user-manager.sh set-email <username> <email>
#
# STDOUT IS A MACHINE INTERFACE. Every subcommand prints JSON and nothing else;
# all diagnostics go to stderr. The settings-center-app dashboard shells out to
# this over SSH (`sudo -n authelia-user-manager.sh ...`) and parses stdout, the
# same way default-app.ts drives env-file-manager.sh.
#
#   list                    -> [{"username","displayname","email","groups":[],"disabled"}]
#   add / set-password      -> {"username","password"}   <- plaintext, shown ONCE
#   claim                   -> {"username","claimed":true[,"password"]}
#   delete / set-email      -> {"username"}
#
# Passwords are never accepted as input and never appear in argv: `authelia
# crypto hash generate argon2 --random` mints the password inside the container
# and prints both it and its digest. The CLI refuses piped stdin ("you must
# either use an interactive terminal or use the --password flag"), and --password
# would put the secret in the host's process list, so --random is the only way to
# get a hash without exposing one. It also happens to be exactly the product
# behaviour we want: the dashboard shows a generated password once.
#
# Why a host script rather than YAML-in-the-dashboard: the file is 0600 and
# root-owned, Authelia rewrites it itself on password change, and the flock below
# is only meaningful on the host where the file lives. Same reasoning that moved
# env-file mutation into env-file-manager.sh.
